# Movie Trailer Website
This is a server-side code project writen in python that stores a list of favorites movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. 
Visitors can review and watch the trailers in a web page.

**_This is the first project submission for Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program._**

## Installation
You need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and a web browser to run this project.

## Usage
To run and navigate thru the web page I've created:
- save the files into a local directory
- open the `entertainment_center.py` file
- click on _Run -> Run Module_
The web page will open in your default browser and you can see my top 6 movies! :-)

## Files
Understanding the files:
`entertainment_center.py`
This is the file that creates the objects movie, the list of movies and also calls the function from fresh_tomatoes script that runs the
web page.

`favicon.ico`
This is just a favicon for the web page that I've included. I hate web pages without favicon! :-)

`fresh_tomatoes.html`
This is the HTML page that's automatically generated by the fresh_tomatoes script.

`fresh_tomatoes.py`
This is the fresh_tomatoes script from Udacity and it's the responsible for all the "magic" that happens!
And if you want to change the styles of the web page, that's the place!

`media.py`
This is the file that contains the class Movie, with the constructor for every movie object and the method to show the relative trailer.

## Built With
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 
- [Fresh Tomatoes](https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode) - python script to generate the movie web page
